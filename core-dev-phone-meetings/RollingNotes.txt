    Review of status of Hackathon branches
    Matters arising

Notes:
    Hyve want to work on Oracle/Postgres support with JnJ.

    The plan is to set up two servers, running Oracle and
    Postgres, and to ytry to use both from a single application.
    This should be simpler than DDL dumps and trying to align the schemas.

    Test data from the hackathon should be made available somewhere.
    Peter will document the datasets on the wiki and check with Terry
    on links to an accessible download URL.

    Ward has added documentation on the transdmart-data
    respository to the wiki. This can be used as the central
    repository for hackathon/1.2 schema and data updates.

    Ami needed somewhere to describe schema changes for merging
    Pfizer code. These can be added in transmart-data

    Venkata asked for the test studies (Cairo) to be removed from
    the installation in 1.2. Peter suggested all test data should
    be separately downloaded and installed using ETL procedures if
    required.

    Dave John reported on Recombinant code merging. Outstanding
    tasks include test and study data. The contacts are the
    hackathon attendees.

    Charlotte reported on Sanofi RC2 progress. Acceptance tests
    for the final sprint will continue next week.


Matters arising:
    Foundation would like to present a poster at Bio-IT World.
    
    Several developers requested wiki accounts which Peter will set up.

transmart-extensions
transmart-java -  essentially isolating Java classes.  I have refactored the transmart-legacy-db to reflect that.   I have not checked in my changes to transmart-legacy-db in as of yet.  My only hesitation is that everything is not tested.    ?  Any thoughts?
biomart-domain -  This isolates all of the domain associated with biomart schema. I have refactored the transmart-legacy-db to reflect that.
search-domain -  This isolates all of the domain associated with searchapp schema. I have refactored the transmart-legacy-db to reflect that.

	Note: the phone meeting for Tuesday, November 19, is the Monthly Users meeting. 
	Invitations forthcoming; please attend. Because of that, there will be
	no developer's phone meeting next week. 

1. Review of the Paris meeting and items arising from that
	- Harm Aarts, @theHyve, is working on a style guide for development, 
	  He will add it to the wiki (or has already)
	  Based on this model
	  http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+style+and+language+feature+guidelines+for+Java+developers
	  (also on Google discuss group)
	- I think it would be a good idea to accept the existing pull requests
	  (review)
	- Other matters arising
2. Transition to 1.2 Alpha
	- Which branch to follow in GitHub
	- Handeling Pending Pull requests
	- Setting up CI testing in Bamboo
	- Database upgrades: Postgres 9.3; Oracle 
	- Which ETL procedure(s)
	- Continuing the “new feature” planning from the Paris workshop

Jay Bergeron presented the work (from the Paris workshop) on setting up committees for 
   Development, Administration, and Architecture. More forthcoming.
Peter Rice presented new features that came out of the User Sessions at the Paris Workshop
   He will be setting up a wiki page showing those with additional information.

=== October 8 meeting -- tranSMART 1.2

 * TranSMART Codebase
 
 - Current 1.1 tranSMART codebase:
   - transmartApp (Grails application)
   https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp   

   Dependencies (published at https://repo.transmartfoundation.org)
   - Rmodules (plugin containing some Advanced Workflows)
   - transmart-core-api
   - transmart-core-db

   (TODO: Terry: pull in changes from https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp/tree/fixes_for_Beta_V1Point1)
   Done - T.
   
   --> Recombinant by Deloitte (Scott Bedard) : 1.1 codebase contributions to GPL
   * Cross Trial Explorer Tree
   * Cohort save feature (Workspace)
   * Faceted Search -- Integrated Search
   * Grid view performance improvements
   Based on 1.0, in the process of merging into 1.1 to provide for 1.2 (around November)
   From chat window - Scott Bedard said: Here are a couple other things RbD is working on: 
   * i2b2 modifier support, gridview enhancements and performance (replaced with jQuery), 
   * new advanced workflows, advanced export, working on patient profile popup off gridview (beta stage)

   --> The Hyve (Kees van Bochove)
   * Faceted Search (J&J HOTFIX) converted to Postgres and merged with 1.1 (based on earlier work by Florian Guitton / Imperial)
   * arrayCGH support (from TraIT)
   * Genome browser
   https://github.com/thehyve/transmartApp
   * GWAS Functionality: https://github.com/thehyve/transmartApp/tree/gwas
   --> Strategy: wait for Recombinant development of GWAS functionality as a plugin (early November - private Pfizer GitHub repository)
   
   --> eTRIKS feature roadmap (Ibrahim Emam)
   * Advanced analyses, grid view, performance upgrades for Search (coming 3-4 months)
   * David Johnson added in chat: Multiple select from study tree to drop into Grid View, 
     and performance of Grid View for very large data sets.
   
   Recommended branching strategy: do a public fork and then have additional developments in a public branch
   Rationale: this is important to achieve transparency within the developer community (e.g. via GitHub graphs)

   Merging strategy: would be useful to have public versions to *test* functionalities of any branches to be merged
   Use pull requests into transmartApp master branch to keep track of code proposals (https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp/pulls)
   

 * Database schema management

   Management across branches, across Oracle-Postgres...
   
   Currently at https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp-DB
   * Database dump: for Oracle (GPL 1.0)
   * Database table extraction: https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp-DB/tree/fixes_for_Beta_V1Point1
     --> has e.g. all biomart schemas in https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp-DB/blob/fixes_for_Beta_V1Point1/postgresql_wGEO/biomart/ddl/biomart.sql
   * Public datasets (GEO datasets) are not not correctly annotated --> public data at http://etriks1.uni.lu
     Can these be contributed? 
   * Public datasets for Across Trial (Scott Bedard) -- will be made available?

   Need for upgrade tracking (David Johnson): create a table in the database that tracks the exact version of the DB schema
   
   Matthew Demerath: It would also be nice to have the DDL to alter tables so migration from one version to another would be easier.
 
   Ami Khandeshi: Need a better way to share public datasets, not sure these should be shared together with the db schema
 
   Proposal for managing database schema's via make across Oracle - Postgres
   https://github.com/thehyve/transmart-data
   - Example data in TSV (db independent)
   - Database specific DDL's 
   - Dynamic make targets for several public datasets (TCGA OV and GEO studies)


=== October 1

Rolling version of combined agenda and notes; core developers phone calls
(these notes are archived on github; transmart/transmart-docs/core-dev-phone-meetings)

For release of v1.1.0 and as a guide to future releases...
	Wiki may not be up to date with regard to the dependencies (tomcat etc.
		that are required/supported for v1.1.0)
	Example/default datasets are a "bit buggy". Public studies in the eTriks 
		http://etriks1.uni.lu are better for the next release (e.g. 1.1.1)
		(involves creating a dump file, including TransmartApp-DB and the 
		TransmartAppInstaller)
		Also, would need to update the documentation
	There is a lot of cleanup needed in the database setup:
		for example, we should have the installer set up the DB without data
		then have options to load public dataset(s) that are in the archive
		Could we have an install script/ and uninstall script for each 'dataset'?
	Master branch need to be brought up to date (in all the projects where
		that applies)
	The JIRA Splint board helped "push" issues forward and focused work on issues.
	There may be a list of issues for JnJ (old JIRA) on the wiki. (??)
	Reorganize so that "release" is part of a Transmart project (merge the 1.1 and 1.2)
		release projects.
	Any news on Transmart Foundation "bug fixing team"? Bug fixes still coming in
		from the community (e.g. eTriks)
	How about "three months" from the 1.1.0 release for bug fix release?

Agenda for future meetings: 

On Oct 1, the proposed agenda is to review the release v1.1.0, and the release process.
	What worked? What problems were there? What can we do to fix it next time?
	What fixes need to be made to JIRA?
	Is the layout and usage of GitHub working?
	Who will be contributing to bug fixes?
	How do we decide on that bugs to fix in v1.1.x releases?
	When do we want to make the next (e.g. v1.1.1) release? 

On Oct 8, the proposed agenda is to start talking about V1.2
	Kees would like to "run" this meeting (I believe)
	He said that he had some idea to present
	(Kees, how about more of an agenda?)

On Oct 15 or 22 - Depends on , Jinlie asked to have David John present on:
	"the transmart team at Deloitte had been working on merging new 
	features from Sanofi/pfizer/Janssen/FDA branches to a new 
	version – still version 1.0 oracle based though and we are 
	trying to figure out how to merge it with the V 1.1."

for the final development of Version 1.1 for release in September. 
Specifically, my proposed agenda is:

  What needs to be done for the release,
  How to conduct weekly sprints,
  What goals are in the first sprint,
  Who is involved in first sprint (taking into account vacations, etc.),
  Schedule for scrum meetings.

For the next six weeks (at least) these phone meetings will largely be dedicated
to the planning and execution of these development sprints.
Onlookers are welcome, of course!

Notes:
	Starting Items:
		Review install process (Zach, Vasu, @ U-MICH)
		JIRA items TBD and assigned
		is anything in ETL/Data loading high priority?
	Tentative plan
		Planning meeting on Tuesday
		Standup/scrum meeting on Thursday
		Where to put notes on activity 
		
	Testing should start with a clean install - also need a public demo version
	Contact original reporting person to see if bug is still a problem (Terry)
	Ask reporting person to demo bug in weekly call and explain problem. 

------ previous meeting -------- 23 July 2013

Meeting agenda - 23 July 2013 - VCF loading deep dive

VCF loading experiences
- Question from Alvaro : loading individual level variant data from VCF files
--> e.g. use case: give me all samples/patients that have a specific variation
--> Creating sample/patient sets is problematic anyway in current tranSMART UI
--> Using it directly in R is possible
--> Alexander: Oracle GPL 1.0 SNP loading - data loads but connection with patients is problematic

 * Variant annotations & summary data

GWAS branch from Pfizer uses the following data model
https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp/tree/GWAS/databaseScripts

 * Variant annotations & summary data loading
 
The VCF.groovy script is used to update variant (meta)data / annotations for the GWAS branch
Groovy scripts at https://github.com/transmart/tranSMART-ETL/blob/master/src/com/recomdata/pipeline/vcf/VCF.groovy
--> Purpose is to parse VCF files and inject the variant annotations directly into the DEAPP/BIOMART tables
--> Tables used are DE_RC_SNP_INFO, DE_SNP_INFO, DE_SNP_INFO, BIOMART.BIO_SNP
--> But these tables seem unused in the tranSMART GPL 1.0 codebase (to verify)
--> But they are in the GWAS branch (to be checked)

 * Individual level data

Schema information from https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp-DB/blob/master/VCF_db_scripts/Oracle/variant_ddl.sql
--> Tables a.o. DE_VARIANT_DATASET, DE_VARIANT_SUBJECT_DETAIL, DE_VARIANT_SUBJECT_IDX
--> Seems to be geared towards individual level data connected to patients
--> ETL quite straightforward
--> J&J branch has some functionality but it seems to be limited to exporting data
--> Can we use R interface to leverage this data?
--> Example link to individual level VCF files: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/consensus_call_sets/snps

 * Individual level data loader script
 
Involves 2 steps
--> 1. Perl script to split VCF file into the various tables DE_VARIANT_DATASET, DE_VARIANT_SUBJECT_DETAIL etc.
--> 2. Uses sqlldr to directly upload into Oracle (makes sense because of very large data volumes)
--> Not in GitHub yet - will be soon

Explanation by Jinlei - integration with IGV:
The current transmart code base supports a simple VCF use case with IGV integration. 
The basic workflow looks like this:
 User starts with cohort selection and create a cohort (one or two subsets)
 User selects the IGV in advanced analysis
 User uses the generic filters in the IGV to select variants(SNPs, genes, pathways)
 User click on the IGV button to get the variant view in IGV with VCF data for the selected cohorts

The [vcf data retrieving service]
(https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp/blob/master/grails-app/services/com/recomdata/transmart/data/export/VcfDataService.groovy)
is implemented in the transmart core which retrieves VCF data for a selected cohort 
and genetic filters. It leverages the domain classes that are mapped to the new [vcf schema]
(https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp-DB/blob/master/VCF_db_scripts/Oracle/variant_ddl.sql). 
The IGV integration is implemented in the Rmodules plugin. 
The IGV service class takes care of the IGV session and parameter file generation.

------ previous meeting -------- 9 July 2013	

Meeting agenda:
	Current branches to integrate in 1.2:
		- Main open source branch 'Postgres'
		- Janssen HOTFIX - Faceted Search
		- Sanofi RC1 - New Search page, modifications to Dataset Explorer
		- Pfizer GWAS
	Core API development
		- General infrastructure
		- Clinical Data API
		- High Dimensional API
		- Knowledge Management API
		- Analysis API
		
	Todo items:
		- Faceted Search integration taskforce: Jonathan, Kees, Florian, Ruslan
			--> Ideally resulting in a db and a UI plugin
		- Pfizer branch integration: extract GWAS functionality into a plugin: Ami
			--> Completion planned sometimes in fall 2013
			--> Components: GWAS data model, GWAS UI - extension of Faceted Search,
			    separate tool: Manhattan Plot (GWAVA)
			--> Have to investigate how much this deviates from J&J HOTFIX Faceted Search
		- VCF importer - https://github.com/transmart/tranSMART-ETL/tree/master/src/com/recomdata/pipeline/vcf
		- Sanofi search interface / program-management --> convert to plugin
		- Sanofi changes to Dataset Explorer - seem limited
		- UI overhaul - ExtJS newer versions impose GPLv3 constraints - move to jQuery UI
			--> Faceted Search is using jQuery, also parts of Sanofi branch
		- Oracle->Postgres support :: move towards definitions in Hibernate / Grails Domain Objects where possible,
			and if database-specific optimizations are necessary, separate them in a (database-specific) plugin
		- Continuous Integration environment taskforce: Terry, (Kees)... --> 1 Oracle and 1 Postgres tranSMART instance
			on https://ci.transmartfoundation.org
		- Developer infrastructure: Nexus (https://repo.transmartfoundation.org), Bamboo (https://ci.transmartfoundation.org),
			Stash (https://code.transmartfoundation.org)
			--> Stash is convenient in that credentials are synchronized with rest of infrastructure
			--> But visibility on GitHub is important
		- Core API next steps: start 1.2 alpha branch, rename artefacts, deploy to Nexus

  faceted search (?)
  
Merge plan for "code freeze" ???
  core-integration -> master 
  + Imperial Branch -> master
  + ?? (master -> GWAS) -> master
  JNJ_GPL1.0_HOTFIX_MERGE - merge moving forward (not quite complete)
  (CTMM-Trait activity?)

Workshop status.
  expect "community building"!
  two "tracks": developers && users
  Target: Roadmap Discussion - try to bring in all the development efforts
  	Security is an issue that needs attention
  	Update the the API "ecosystem"
  	ETL process/effort - discussion of current process; sharing scripts/knowledge
  	  what resources to introduce new people to ETL process
  	  perhaps framed in terms of purpose/goals
  	
Other?
  Kees: based on calls with others - updating API requirements;
    see background notes: http://thehyve.github.io/transmart-core-api/

Workshop preparations. Well under way! Hope everyone is registered that wants to be! 
Faceted search. Continues...
Analysis portion. copy number veration data; implementing survival analysis and group test
  Fixed marker selection... works continues
API (esp. High Dimensional data). Might want to add a sample dimension. Under discussion...
  http://thehyve.github.io/transmart-core-api/ - API docs starter
Status of branches (merge).
Other...

Release plan 
	GWAS functionality (waiting to hear: go or no go)
	add test master (code freeze) against Oracle
	github workflow; tagging and providing a "code freeze" source archive (might be better then a fork)

Previous notes, May 21
==========
Progress items: (got to clean this up!)
Faceted search waiting for addition data from Jenson
API - Need more input from community
Sample data is ready (was a slight error; fixed)
Analysis portion (theHyve) being worked on: new functionality for dealing with variation data
Search: there are problems? (Postgres version)
	Venkata working on this
Merge (locally) and bug fixes: JNJ_GPL1.0_HOTFIX_MERGE
	Schema changes need for both ETL and Search for micro array data
Analysis functionality (Shicai)
	Micro array requires SQL scripts to be run; after ETL has run
	Kees has the "magic"!
		
Items from phone call with tranSMART foundation
	release planning (deadlines: Alpha, May 15; Beta, June 15; Release, Sept 15)
	testing and documentation (unit tests! integration tests!)
	
Branches of transmartApp:
master - the main, active, working branch

GWAS - dev branch; not yet for release
	Client implementation (Recom); 
	meta data for study (e.g. show definitions)
	self upload of meta-data
	(to be discussed at workshop; first steps get the code in github)
ImperialBranch - core release
	On going development at Imperial
	some fixes needs
JNJ_GPL1.0_HOTFIX_MERGE - hidden in core release for June
	faceted search from Jenson
	ETL - Scripts for new search table?
	Merge will be a problem?
	Postgres Migration does not currently support search!
core-integration - core release
	implementation of the transmart-core-api in the current transmartApp
	ready for merging; waiting on other tester's (done at Imperial)
dynamic_db_example - old code? (drop?)
hotfix-GPL1.0_GA - drop branch tag?
unit_test_fixes - drop
workshop_test_fixes	- drop
	
Current status on
	getting standard DB for testing and demo
		Manish working on dump; Public clinical data trails; still vetting 'releasability'
		See also (in github, transmartApp-DB, postgresMigrate branch):
		https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp-DB/tree/postgresMigrate/postgresql_version
	ETL/Data Loading
		Clinical and Gene Expression data loaded (@ Imperial) with old scripts; updating
	Core development
		Documentation of API, looking for tools (minimal -> JavaDoc) Kees
			- API's for HD data! (Looking for feed-back!)
		Document data schema and ETL
	API work/status
		Manish, Michael, mapping of I2B2 to API core-API (tests to be sent out)
		API "sub committee"
			working on new API for high dimensional data: 
				Manish, Gustavo, Michael, and TBD from Imperial
	Test of GUI elements
		(Automation: Selenium)
		http://transmartproject.org/wiki/display/TSMTGPL/QA+Testing
		
	
-------------
Previous Notes:

	- discussion of testing
		review of https://ci.ctmmtrait.nl/browse/TM-TMF-22
		types of tests: unit test, integration tests, web tests
		integration testing requires:
			a working public server 
			working pubic test data (for example, the conversion of the GEO data from transmartApp 1.0)
			GEO studies from 1.0 (get accession numbers?)
			Stabilizing the database schema (as grails domain classes)
			ETL for loading data (microarray and clinical working)
			Missing SNP data (J&J working on this)
	- opportunity for GUI testing
		gui test scripts (paper version)
		automation of these scripts (or scripts like them)
		using Selenium: 
		
		
	- review of current efforts

	Umich current unit test; as data is available the integrations test
	Imperial, data loading; GUI interface into test
	

A review of the current efforts
   UMich
*     domain object review (coverage); and unit test; API demo
*     still working on Jira 
   Imperial (and University of Luxembourg on ETL)
	  loading data for search app; may be missing tables!!
		Where does compound and pathway data go (in the database)?
      ETL loading
        focus on clinical data
		currently loading Genomics data
*       This is priority!
		Getting help and data dump from Recombinant (Manish)
 	Problems with user name/configuration tables
*       Ontologies not working on interface
      Work with theHyve on core after Easter
   theHyve
	  ETL - made several corrections to the tables (in PostgreSQL) to support the ETL process
	  Problems with Clinical Data
      coreIntegration branch (working on CRC API)
        i2b2 factored out! (that is "hidden behind the API")
*       implementation of CRC-from-i2b2 involves learning meaning of tables
	some issues surrounding security (needs review!)
          bug exists that hides ontology tree if not admin??
          non-admin users "should" see ontology tree grayed out
	  (in review by Manish; et al)
        Notes on API (CRC):
	  notes can be attached "anywhere"; not used much in current GUI
      problems with postgreSQL with respect to
        images
    RModules addition
	  analysis R routines in theHyve github
	see PULL REQUST at transmartApp
      looking at the "job execution" part of Transmart; Galexy/Chipster as a candidate
	  Grid scheduling 
	  Working with high-performance center at Amsterdam

Next tasks (future directions)
  REMINDER: unit tests!
  API for analysis part of dataset explore (including job execution)
    who are the users? workflow? stories? roles?
    plugin framework?
  API high dimensional data
  
  GUI improvements
    examination of XJS?
    identify API?
    who are the users? workflow? stories? roles?
      some work on this at BioIT World
    what role SPOTFIRE?
    
  J&J "facited search" integration into TrasnmartApp (more information post BioIT World)
  API for search (depends on the update of the search page; and inclusion of the new search)
        
Update/add goals and Identify early milestones
Expand/Create tasks list

Process (phone call, communications, coordination)
 What's working?
 Where are there problems?
 What fixes?
